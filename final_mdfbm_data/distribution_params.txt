force weight = 0.25
A = force_weight/bins_per_len = 0.025
walkers per ensemble = 64
number of ensembles in integrated distributions = 120 
number of ensembles in instantaneous distributions = 120 (nt=2^27), 480 (nt=2^23,nt=2^25), 1080 (nt=2^14,nt=2^18)
bins per unit length = 10

Rebinning paramaters: 

The "number of bins" is the number of bins between the first and last non-zero data point in each distribution data file. 
For those distributions that are both scaled and integrated, the "number of bins" parameter is the number of bins 
between the first non-zero data point of the largest NT distribution (2^27), and the "number of bins" is multiplied
by a factor of 3/4 for every smaller NT (2^23, 2^25). 

alpha=1.5 integrated distribution: 
number of bins = 100 (scaled), 50 (unscaled)

alpha=1.5 instantaneous distribution: 
number of bins = 40 (scaled), 50 (unscaled)

alpha=1.0 integrated distribution: 
number of bins = 50 (scaled), 30 (unscaled)

alpha=1.0 instantaneous distribution: 
number of bins = 35 (scaled), 40 (unscaled)
